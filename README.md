# automatedFormTest
Brings together use of Selenium, data driven framework and testNg

I have a dummy form. Using Selenium  I have automated the process of testing the form. 
Data has been seperarated from the test scripts with an excel spread sheet.
I have used testNG to enhance the reporting aspect of the tests.
